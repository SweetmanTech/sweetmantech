# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a 26-year-old maker, and I love building music nfts. ðŸŒ›ðŸ”®ðŸŒœ

I'm working on a decentralized toolkit for musicians. ðŸ§°ðŸ’¿ 
I used to work with [MintSongs](https://zora.co/collections/0x2B5426A5B98a3E366230ebA9f95a24f09Ae4a584), minting over 70,000+ music NFTs for musicians around the world. 

In my free time, I like to [write](https://mirror.xyz/sweetman.eth), and build lots of side projects. Here are a few:

- [onchain-music-metadata](https://github.com/SweetmanTech/Onchain-Music-Metadata): standardized music nft metadata. Pioneered by [Catalog](https://catalog.works/) (built on [Zora](https://docs.zora.co/docs/intro)).
- [raibowkit-token-gated](https://github.com/SweetmanTech/rainbowkit-token-gated): website for fans to claim your music nfts. built on [Rainbowkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/).
