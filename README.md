# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a 20-year-old maker, and I love building things.

I work at [Worldcoin](https://worldcoin.org/), building the most scalable & private sybil-resistance solution. Before that I worked at [Showtime](https://showtime.io/?ref=miguel), an NFT social network.

On my free time, I like to [write](https://miguelpiedrafita.com/articles), and build lots of side projects. Here are a few:

- [lil-web3](https://github.com/m1guelpf/lil-web3): Simple, intentionally-limited versions of web3 protocols & apps.
- [connect4-sol](https://github.com/m1guelpf/connect4-sol): A hyper-optimised Connect 4 implementation on Solidity.
- [php evm](https://github.com/m1guelpf/php-evm): An Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation on PHP (cuz why not).
- [proof of kyc](https://github.com/m1guelpf/proof-of-kyc): UX-friendly sybil-resistance solution, powered by Stripe Identity.
- [roam app](https://github.com/m1guelpf/roam-app): An iOS app for Roam Research, including a "Share to Roam" extension.
- [Sitesauce](https://sitesauce.app): A one-click solution to create static sites from dynamic websites, and keep them updated.
