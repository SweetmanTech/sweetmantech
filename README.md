# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a smart contract (solidity) + javascript engineer, and I love music nfts. ðŸŒ›ðŸ”®ðŸŒœ

I'm working on a decentralized toolkit for musicians. ðŸ§°

I'm an independent software engineer. I used to work with [mint songs](https://zora.co/collections/0x2B5426A5B98a3E366230ebA9f95a24f09Ae4a584), helping musicians mint over 70,000+ music NFTs. ðŸ’¿  

In my free time, I like to [write](https://mirror.xyz/sweetman.eth), and build lots of side projects. Here are a few:

- [onchain-music-metadata](https://github.com/SweetmanTech/Onchain-Music-Metadata) (`npm i onchain-music-metadata`): the music nft metadata. Pioneered by [Catalog](https://catalog.works/) (built on [Zora](https://docs.zora.co/docs/intro)). ðŸŽ¼
- [raibowkit-token-gated](https://github.com/SweetmanTech/rainbowkit-token-gated): website for fans to claim your music nfts. built on [Rainbowkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/). ðŸŒˆ
- [music-nft-factory-smart-contracts](https://github.com/SweetmanTech/music-nft-factory-smart-contracts): custom smart contract factory on Polygon / Ethereum / Optimism / etc. ðŸŽ¸
- [music-nft-factory-UI](https://github.com/SweetmanTech/music-nft-factory-UI): UI for [music-nft-factory-smart-contracts](https://github.com/SweetmanTech/music-nft-factory-smart-contracts). ðŸ”®
