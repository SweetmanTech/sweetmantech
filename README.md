# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a 19-year-old who makes stuff on the internet.

I'm currently working at [Showtime](https://tryshowtime.com) (an NFT social network) and building way too many things on the side, like [Sitesauce](https://sitesauce.app) (a one-click solution to create static sites from any dynamically-generated website, and keep them updated when content changes), or [dm.link] (newsletters in Twitter DMs!). I also [live-code on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/m1guelpf) sometimes.

I'm also the guy who started [Auralite](https://auralite.io), a new kind of social network that doesn't track you or try to get you addicted. It's built to be open and extendable, embracing open standards like RSS and webmentions, and providing an open API. It's currently on pause while I figure out the best way to fund it, but I want to get back to it at some point.

Before that, I built and sold [Blogcast](https://blogcast.host), a service that uses state of the art text-to-speech technology to automate article narration. I also built and sold [UnMarkDocs](https://unmarkdocs.co), an service to generate beautiful documentation pages with super-powerered markdown.

If you've reached this point, you probably want to [learn more about my projects](https://miguelpiedrafita.com/projects) or [read my articles](https://miguelpiedrafita.com/articles). You can also [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/m1guelpf), where I actively share what I'm working on, and [on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/m1guelpf) to get notified when I go live to do some coding.
